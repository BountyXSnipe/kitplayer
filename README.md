# CrossCode Playable Kit Mod

Play as guest character Kit via swapping Lea's sprites to Kit. This mod does not change dialogue, cutscene sprites or face sprites at the moment. It is an incomplete mod, and there are still some animations that need polishing, or dedicated sprites for the given directions (most diagonal animations are missing).

## Installation instructions:
1. Click the green button that says "Clone or Download", then click "Download Zip"
2. Open the downloaded zip folder
3. Extract the "kitplayer" folder to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\CrossCode\assets\mods or whichever location has the mods folder.
4. Enjoy!
(Optional: CCLoader can be used to enable or disable installed mods. You can get CCLoader here https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader)



## Credits:
- Kit character made by HerrDekay. Check out his WIP game Lunistice. https://twitter.com/AGrumpyFox
- Kit's base sprites and portrait made by Lachsen
- Kit's additional animations, and spritesheet extension are drawn by BountyXSnipe.

## Stretch goals:
- Kit as a party member (might be a seperate mod)
- Dialogue changes (will not cover translations)

## Mod Compatibility

### Conflicts or Interferes.
- **Qine Mod**. CrossCode\assets\media\gui\severed-heads.png is conflicted. **Non-breaking** but Qine's head icon will be missing or Qine's mod will overwrite Kit's head icon.
- Any mod that directly replaces Lea's sprites and/or CrossCode\assets\media\gui\menu.png
