# CrossCode Playable Kit Mod

Play as guest character Kit via swapping Lea's sprites to Kit. This mod does not change dialogue, cutscene sprites or face sprites at the moment. It is an incomplete mod, and there are still some animations that need polishing, or dedicated sprites for the given directions (most diagonal animations are missing).

## Installation instructions:
1. Make sure you have CCLoader installed in the CrossCode folder. You can get CCLoader here https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader
2. Click the green button that says "Clone or Download", then click "Download Zip"
3. Open the downloaded zip folder
4. Extract the "kitplayer" folder to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\CrossCode\assets\mods or whichever location has the mods folder.
5. Enjoy! You can disable the mod in the game options but will require a restart.

- Kit's base sprites and portrait made by Lachsen
- Kit's additional animations, and spritesheet extension are drawn by BountyXSnipe.

## Stretch goals:
- Kit as a party member (might be a seperate mod)
- Dialogue changes (will not cover translations)

## Mod Compatibility

### May Interfere. Non Breaking
- Any mod that directly replaces Lea's sprites
- Mods that modify the "severed-heads.png" in the CrossCode\assets\media\gui such as Qine mod
